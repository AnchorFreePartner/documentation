## Actions

### Add

You can add a new pool by clicking the "**Add pool**" button in the upper right corner; the corresponding dialog box will appear:

{% hint style="warning" %}
New pools are created **Public** by default. It's currently unavailable to change the type manually.
{% endhint %}

Pool **name** and **permissions** are mandatory to fill. Keep in mind that pool **name** is a **unique** identifier; attempting to use an existing name will result in an error "**Pool already exists**" and your pool will not be created:

Necessary permissions \(multiple\) should be chosen from the predefined list. The field supports text search:

Different set of permissions can be specified for several projects by clicking the "**Add** **permission**" button.

### Copy

Any pool from the list can be copied fully \(including type\) by clicking on ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/export_icon.png) button. A postfix representing current time in [unix epoch format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) \(e.g. _\_1622643592669_\) will be added to the new pool name.

### Edit

The edit screen repeats the add screen in terms of both the set of fields and the logic. This functionality is available by clicking on ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/edit_icon.png) button.

### Delete

Any pool supplied with ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/delete_icon.png) button can be deleted; a confirmation dialog will appear:
