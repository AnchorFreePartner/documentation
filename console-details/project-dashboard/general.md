## Graphs

### Active Sessions by Protocol

The graph “**Active Sessions by Protocol**” shows a realtime number of active sessions per VPN protocol. We use the most popular VPN protocols for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows platforms like OpenVPN, IPSec, and also designed and patented by Pango HYDRA protocol which is more advanced and has higher performance benchmarks for now.
