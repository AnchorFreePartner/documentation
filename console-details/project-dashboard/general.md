## Graphs

### Active Sessions by Protocol

The graph “**Active Sessions by Protocol**” shows a real-time number of active sessions per VPN protocol. We use the most popular VPN protocols for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows platforms like OpenVPN, IPSec, and also the HYDRA protocol, designed and patented by Aura, that is more advanced and has higher performance benchmarks in this day and age. &#x20;

#### Details

We can see active sessions per-protocol just by clicking particular colored lines in the graph and check how many sessions were active in a certain time frame or even in a certain minute.

### Active Sessions by Locations

The graph shows us the amount of real-time sessions per virtual location and you can see the more popular virtual locations chosen by users. For anonymous users, this graph shows an optimal server location. &#x20;

#### Details

There, we can see all virtual locations for all active users, including anonymous and paid users. To look up a detailed list, just click on the graph line and open a pop-up menu. To select a certain country, click the country code. The list of virtual locations is scrollable.

For countries, the ALPHA-2 codes are used.
