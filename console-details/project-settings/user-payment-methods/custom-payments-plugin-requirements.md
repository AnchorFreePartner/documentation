# Payments Plugin requirements

You need a payment plugin if your application uses another payment service, not supported by the Platform.

## Payment Flow

**Step 1.** Your App buys a subscription in your Payment service and gets a purchase receipt.

**Step 2.** Send ****the ****_purchase receipt_ to the Platform side:

1. the App calls POST [`/user/purchase`](https://backend.northghost.com/doc/all/index.html#!/user-controller/sendPurchase) \(SDK includes the same method\) with parameters `token = your purchase receipt` and `type = name your plagin`.
2. your Backend calls [POST](https://backend.northghost.com/doc/all/index.html#!/partner-controller/sendPurchaseByPartner) [`/partner/subscribers/{user_id}/purchase`](https://backend.northghost.com/doc/all/index.html#!/partner-controller/sendPurchaseByPartner) with parameters `body = your purchase receipt` and `user_id = the user ID`.

**Step 3.** The Platform verifies the purchase receipt in your Payment service. 

* If the result is _Failed_, the Platform:
  * returns the error code. 
* If the result is _Success_, the Platform:
  * changes a user's status to _Paid_,
  * changes the user's traffic limit to _Unlimited,_
  * sends a _purchase\_id_ to the App_._

**Step 4.**  The Platform will check the _Purchase receipt_ every 24 hours.

* If the result is _Success_, the Platform:
  * does nothing.
* If the result is _Failed_, the Platform:  
  * changes the user's status to _Free_ ,
  * changes the user's bandwidth limit to _Free limit = 100Mb._
