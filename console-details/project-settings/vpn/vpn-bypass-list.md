# VPN Bypass list

Some traffic \(by domain\) can avoid the VPN tunnel and go to the Internet directly. To access the feature, add domains to this Bypass list.

## Actions

### Manually adding a single Domain

If you are going to add one domain to the Bypass list of your project, do the following:

1. Click "![](../../../.gitbook/assets/plus_icon.jpeg)**Add**". A new line without a domain will be created in the list of domains.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/add_url_bypasslist.png)

  2. Enter the domain and then click **Add**. The domain will then be moved to the bottom of the list.

{% hint style="info" %}
 You can use special characters like "\*". For example: 

* `*.google.com` — all domains google.com
* `*.exploit.*` — all domains containing the`exploit`string
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
if your domain is incorrect, you will get the error message "**Domain is not valid**".  
{% endhint %}

  3. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for other domains.

  4. Click **Save** so that the changes are saved. As a result, you will see the form for approval of a new Bypass list.

```

  2. Click ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/upload_icon.png) **Upload** and select the text file. You will see all domains in your Bypass list:

If a domain is incorrect, you will see the error message "**Domain is not valid**" \(see domain _!@\#.fg_ in the screenshot above\).
{% endhint %}

The incorrect domain will not be included in the new Bypass list \(see screenshot above\).
{% endhint %}
