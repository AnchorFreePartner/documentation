# Pango Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

The growing number of security threats has urged the EU government to introduce new regulations outlining the requirements companies have to comply with to work in the EU. This law is called the General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\). Pango fully complies with this regulation, making your data protected from hackers.

Some of the key privacy and data protection requirements of the GDPR include:

* Requiring the consent of subjects for data processing
* Anonymizing collected data to protect privacy
* Providing data breach notifications
* Safely handling the transfer of data across borders
* Requiring certain companies to appoint a data protection officer to oversee GDPR compliance
