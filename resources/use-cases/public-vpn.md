# Public VPN

The main features of VPN are:

* Your real IP address is replaced with a virtual IP, so all the services you access think you are situated elsewhere;
* Whatever node you choose, thousands of people are using it day and night, thus it is much harder for other people to trace what websites you have accessed;
* All the traffic from your computer to the node is encrypted, even if you are using a public network, so a potential hacker is much less likely to intercept it;
* To create an application for users to use, you do not have to go elsewhere, we got it covered:
