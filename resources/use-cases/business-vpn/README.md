# Business VPN

## Description

Business VPN is a type of VPN project that is aimed towards providing a list of users with fast and secure vpn with several other privileges.

Business VPN is different from Public VPN in several aspects:

* Only a certain predefined array of users can use it;
* Connection to this type of vpn is more secure and stable;
* Users can have no data limit, depending on how the project is configured;
* Users do not have to watch advertisements;
* A project owner can add various additional bonuses for the users;
* Users can access the vpn via either the [Wifi Security for Business](https://app.gitbook.com/@pango/s/pango-platform/~/drafts/-M7wzLasQRRLtTcd4KmQ/resources/use-cases/business-vpn/wifi-security-for-business) app, or a custom dedicated app.
