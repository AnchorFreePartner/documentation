# Wi-Fi Security for Business

The first thing you see after launching the 'Wi-Fi Security for Business' application is a log-in screen:

There, you \(or a user you have added to the project\) have to enter credentials to access the project. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that even if you are the owner of the project, you have to add a user for yourself to access the vpn.
{% endhint %}

After a successful authentication, you will be directed to the main screen of the application and connected to the most suitable vpn server \(diplayed in the top-right portion of the screen\):

On this screen, you can:

* Choose a server in a 'Virtual location' drop-down menu on the right
* Stop sending your data through a vpn tunnel by pressing the big 'Power' button on the left
* Check your virtual address, how much data has been uploaded and downloaded through vpn and how much data has been secured

By clicking on the three lines in the top-left corner, you can expand the menu on the left, revealing the names of the menu items:
