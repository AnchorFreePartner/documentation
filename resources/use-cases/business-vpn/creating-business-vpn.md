# Creating a Business VPN Project

## Creating a Business VPN Project

First, you need to sign up to the management console. Required steps are described on the ['Sign Up to Developer console' page](https://app.gitbook.com/@pango/s/pango-platform/~/drafts/-M7Nmxtwc21AtQC8MweG/start-exploring/sign-up-to-dev-console).

Second, it is time to create the first project following the steps described on the ['Create the new Project' page](https://app.gitbook.com/@pango/s/pango-platform/~/drafts/-M7Nmxtwc21AtQC8MweG/start-exploring/add-a-new-project).

{% hint style="warning" %}
In the creation form, choose 'Private VPN' in a drop-down list titled 'Project type' and choose a preferred authorisation type, Email or User ID.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Email" %}
If you choose Email as the authorisation type, then when adding new users to the project, you will need to enter their email address to grant them access to the VPN. They will have to use this email and a provided password to access the VPN via the Wifi Security for Business app.

{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

If you choose User ID as the authorisation type, then when adding new users to the project, you will need to enter their ID to grant them access to the VPN. They will have to use this ID and a provided password to access the VPN via the Wifi Security for Business app.
