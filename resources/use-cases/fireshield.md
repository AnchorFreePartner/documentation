# Fireshield

Fireshield is a unique and fast technology that allows monitoring of all user's DNS requests in real-time. The main idea to get a response with full information about this domain. There is a minimal latency when checking DNS request. 

Why latency is minimal?

* Your developed VPN app has a White list. 
* The server-side has some levels of cache\(VPN node has its own cache, Fireshield server has a full database of websites\)

How can you use Fireshield technology?

* Malware and phishing protection
* Avoid getting ads

 All requests to tracker websites will be blocked.

* Parent control feature 

As a parent, you can control your kids' actions on the Internet. Fireshield knows the full information about the domain and the client application will display or not display the desired website depending on the user age.

* Government control feature

Develop your own VPN application that complies with government laws and regulations. 

* Organization control feature 

As a company owner or manager, you can limit access to a specific list of websites for your employees at work

* College and university control feature

As a principal of the college, you can limit access to a specific list of websites \(social networks\) for students during study time at college or university 

Android, iOS, and Win SDK support the Fireshield feature.

3. Open Setting page, General tab
