# Does the current version of Fireshield support leverage IP and name server data, subnets blocking?

The current implementation can store and apply IP subnet rules stored on the client. If needed, we can add support for dynamic checking of IP addresses used by the client applications, whether or not the IP address was first resolved by specific DNS.
