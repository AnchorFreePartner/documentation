# What data is collected by the Platform?

The platform collects 3 types of data:

* [Project users and devices](what-data-collect-the-platform.md#project-users-and-devices-data)
* [VPN session statistic](what-data-collect-the-platform.md#vpn-session-statistic)
* [SDK events](what-data-collect-the-platform.md#sdk-events)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The platform **does not collect** or analyze any **Personal Identifiable Information. **

* all the identifiers are auto-generated
{% endhint %}

## Project users and devices data
