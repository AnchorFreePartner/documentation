# What analytic data is collected by your SDK?

The main purpose of this is to improve the connection quality of the SDK. SDK collects anonymous data about a device and connection start and stop attempts.

SDK performs Network Availability Test for better understanding what's happening when a connection error is received. It includes diagnostics of the current network connection such as a Captive Portal check, pinging of a popular public web resource, etc.

{% hint style="warning" %}
SDK **does not collect** or analyze any **Personal Identifiable Information.** 

* all the geolocation data is inaccurate and provide an approximation
* cell phone service provider and ISP data is used for statistical purposes only
* any hardware information is used for the service quiality improvement
* all the identifers are auto-generated
{% endhint %}

## Connection events

{% hint style="warning" %}
The latest version of SDK provides **an option to turn** on/**off event sending**. It is up to the application developer to use or not use this function of the SDK.
{% endhint %}

There are 4 connection events:

* **connection\_start,** 
* **connections\_start\_detailed,** 
* **connection\_end,** 
* **connection\_end\_detailed**. 

We are using **\*\_detailed** events mostly for diagnostic if a connection really works and what the possible reason for a connection could not be established.

### Event: _connection\_start_

Event reports every connection attempt.

Properties specific for event _connection\_start_:

| **Property Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| duration | Integer | how long it took to establish a connection or stop trying to connect, in **milliseconds** |
| notes | JSON | Provides additional information if any related to the connection process. |

### Event: _connection\_start\_detailed_

Event reports additional details regarding all finished connection attempts to particular IPs \(main, offload\), including successful.

If the connection attempt was unsuccessful, a network availability check should be performed and reported in network\_availability and notes properties.

Properties specific for event _connection\_start\_detailed_:

| **Property Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| network\_availability | Float | Share of passed Network Availability tests rounded to 2 digits after the decimal point. |
| notes | JSON | detailed results of the Network Availability Test. |
| details | JSON | an array of JSON with connection results of all low-level attempts to connect. |

### Event: _connection\_end_

The event should be reported when a Connection is terminated. All properties specific for connection-related events should be reported for this event as well.

Properties specific for event _connection\_end_:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Property Name</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Type</th>

        </p>
        <p><code>}</code>
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

When a connection is terminated unexpectedly \(no user intention to terminate the session\), network availability tests should be performed and _connection\_end\_detailed_ event should be reported. If a user has canceled, no need to send the event.  
Properties specific for event _connection\_end\_detailed:_

| **Property Name** | **Type** | **Notes** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| network\_availability | Float | Share of passed Network Availability tests rounded to 2 digits after the decimal point. |
| notes | JSON | detailed results of the Network Availability Test. |

### Property for “_error\_code_”

#### _connection\_start_

| **error\_code** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 \(success\) | No error \(the connection has been established successfully\) |
| 1 \(internal error\) | Internal problems during initialization or establishing communication \(e.g. Failed to open TUN, VPN permissions are not given, Hydra "Bad Configuration" error, etc.\) or any other unclassified errors |
| 2 \(connection error\) | Failed to establish a connection due to networking issues \(e.g. host is unreachable, can't send data, timeout on receiving data, etc.\) |
| 4 \("no network" error\) | The network has been lost during the connection \(e.g. WiFi lost or changed\) or the network is up, but unavailable \(e.g. due to a walled garden or as mobile data is disabled\) |
| 6 \(canceled\) | The connection establishment has been terminated in the middle of the process. No connection has been established. |
| 7 \(app level error\) | Application denied starting establishing the VPN connection \(i.e. user tried to use some elite features from the free app, PC adapter is not ready to connect\) |

#### _connection\_end_

| **error\_code** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 \(success\) | No error \(the connection has ended as expected and successfully\) |
| 1 \(internal error\) | An internal problem that broke established connection \(e.g. OpenVPN or Hydra quit unexpectedly, etc.\) |
| 2 \(connection error\) | The connection has broken due to connection problems \(e.g. Hydra or OpenVPN detected communication problem, etc.\) |
| 3 \(connection stuck\) | Connection is established, but no exchange happening \("KeepAlive problem"\) |

### Property for “_error_”

| error\_code | error | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Success | No error |
| 1 | Internal error | Platform-specific internal problems during initialization, connection, or operation. \(e.g. Failed to open TUN, Hydra "Bad configuration" error, VPN permissions are not given, etc.\) Also, this code should be used for any unclassified errors \(with a detailed description\). |
| 2 | Connection error | The error should be supplied with an HTTP code / VPN error code. This code is used for the situation when a connection has not been established or has been broken. |
| 3 | Connection stuck | The connection has been established, but no data exchange is happening. Should be supplied with a platform-specific description. |
| 4 | No network | The network connection has been lost during the VPN session |
| 5 | Failed | The backend has responded with an error. A relevant error should be provided. |

### connection\_start

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| m\_ui | Connection is initiated via interaction with the UI elements |
| m\_system | Connection is initiated via interaction with the system menu |
| m\_tray | Connection is initiated via interaction with a notification message or a tile |
| m\_other | Connection is initiated via some other type of interaction |
| a\_app\_run | Connection is initiated automatically on the app launch |
| a\_reconnect | Connection is initiated after an intended VPN session termination |
| a\_error | Connection is initiated as a result of an unexpected VPN session disconnect |
| a\_sleep | Connection is initiated after a device has returned from the sleep/hibernation mode |
| a\_network | Connection is initiated due to the network status change |
| a\_other | Connection is initiated automatically due to any other reason |

There are several reasons for a connection attempt to fail or an established connection to drop unexpectedly. It can be an infrastructure issue or a client bug that can and shall be fixed. It can be a blockage that should be addressed by changing the configuration or in the worst case improving the VPN core and re-releasing the client. But it can also be a. problem with the network that can’t be fixed in principle.

In order to distinguish these cases, a **network availability test** will be performed on every unsuccessful connect or unintended disconnect that will report whether the network is available or not.

This test includes: check the captive portal, current network type, ping test, and security certificate test.

### Captive Portal test

This test is to check if there is a Captive portal. It usually means that  
all requests are redirected by the network provider to their own login page.

To detect this case SDK sends a request to one of URLs from the list and expects response code 204:  
[https://google.com/generate\_204](https://google.com/generate_204),  
[https://gstatic.com/generate\_204](https://gstatic.com/generate_204),  
[https://maps.google.com/generate\_204](https://maps.google.com/generate_204),  
[https://www.google.com/generate\_204](https://www.google.com/generate_204),  
[https://clients3.google.com/generate\_204](https://clients3.google.com/generate_204)

### Ping test

TODO

### Network type test

SDK calls system API to check if any type of network interface is established. For example on older versions of Android SDK uses API  
[https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager\#getNetworkInfo\(android.net.Network](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager#getNetworkInfo%28android.net.Network)\)

### Certificate test

In some particular cases, there can be more significant issues with your connection like issues with web certificates. To test this case SDK sends a request to one of the following URL and checks that the certificate is valid:

[https://google.com/](https://google.com/),  
[https://apple.com](https://apple.com),  
[https://microsoft.com](https://microsoft.com),
