# Switch projects

As you add more projects, you may need to quickly switch between them within the Management Console. This can be done using the menu in the upper left corner.

A click on the menu will open it. It displays a list of your projects, the one you are currently working on is checked:

Clicking on the name of another project will switch the Management Console to work with it.

Is some cases the list of projects can become too long to scroll; you can type the full name (or a part) of the project in the search field. This will automatically filter the list.
{% endhint %}

By clicking on the "**All project**" menu item, you will be redirected to the projects overview dashboard:

Projects on the dashboard can be viewed as a list or a grid** **by clicking on the respective button between "Search" and "Add project"
{% endhint %}
