4\. Fill all available fields:

* **Project name**. It should be a unique name; it can contain Latin characters and numbers. This field is mandatory.
* **Project ID.** The ID should be unique; it can contain Latin characters and numbers. The project ID is also called a carrier. This field is mandatory.
* **Description.** It is a description of the project, e.g. its purpose or target audience.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Using the **Upload image** button, you can upload a project icon that will be displayed near the project name. This is optional.
{% endhint %}

5\. Click **Create**

Next, you will see your project's dashboard:

{% hint style="info" %}
Since your new project is not configured yet, there will be not much information in the dashboard.
{% endhint %}



**Configuring a recently added project**

1. Add a list of locations:

{% content-ref url="../console-details/network-locations/" %}
[network-locations](../console-details/network-locations/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

&#x20;   2\. Add a list of project management members:

{% content-ref url="../console-details/project-settings/members.md" %}
[members.md](../console-details/project-settings/members.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
