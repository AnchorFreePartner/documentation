# Payments Plugin requirements

You need a payment plugin if your application uses another payment service, not supported in the Platform side payment methods.

## Payment Flow

**Step 1.** Your App made a subscription in your Payment service and get a purchase receipt.

**Step 2.** Send ****the ****_purchase receipt_ to the Platform side:

1. the App call POST [`/user/purchase`](https://backend.northghost.com/doc/all/index.html#!/user-controller/sendPurchase) \(SDK include the same method\) with parameters `token = your purchase receipt` and `type = name your plagin`.
2. your Backend call [POST](https://backend.northghost.com/doc/all/index.html#!/partner-controller/sendPurchaseByPartner) [`/partner/subscribers/{user_id}/purchase`](https://backend.northghost.com/doc/all/index.html#!/partner-controller/sendPurchaseByPartner) with parameters `body = your purchase receipt` and `user_id = the user ID`.

**Step 3.** The Platform verifies the purchase receipt in your Payment service. 

* If the result _Failed_, the Platform:
  * returns the error code. 
* If the result _Success_, the Platform:
  * changes the user status to _Paid_ ,
  * changes the user bandwidth limit to _Unlimited,_
  * send to App _purchase\_id._

**Step 4.**  The Platform will check check the _Purchase receipt_ each 24 hours.

* If the result _Success_, the Platform:
  * does nothing.
* If the result _Failed_, the Platform:  
  * changes the user status to _Free_ ,
  * changes the user bandwidth limit to _Free limit = 100Mb._
