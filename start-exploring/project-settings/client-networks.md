Authorized \(If the network has a password or not\) options are Yes, No or "Does not matter".

Finally, pick the Action option.   Either select enable or disable, to automatically turn on the VPN \(enable\) or turn off the VPN when this network is used.

**Download**

Selecting this option will cause the list of networks to be downloaded as a JSON file onto your device.

**Editing an Existing Network**

Just select the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2813%29.png) pencil to the right of the name of the network that you want to modify. Make sure to click on save after any changes.

**Deleting a Network**

Click on the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png) trash can  that is right of the network that needs to be deleted.

**Priority of Rules**

In the picture below, the BobsNetwork is on the first line as well as the second.  The way the system works, the higher on this list the higher the priority the rules of the network are given.  In this situation, BobsNetwork will have the VPN enabled and will ignore the second line where it disables the VPN.
